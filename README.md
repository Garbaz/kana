# Kana

Similar to tools like [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/), but keeps track of which kana the user gets wrong and/or take a long time to think of the reading, and preferably shows these.

Written in [Processing](https://processing.org/).

The current "scores" for each kana are stored at program exit in `saved_scores.csv`. To start from a clean slate, delete the `saved_scores.csv` file.
