# Kana

Similar to tools like [Real Kana](https://realkana.com/), but keeps track of which kana the user gets wrong and/or take a long time to think of the reading, and preferably shows these.

The current "scores" for each kana are stored at program exit in `saved_scores.csv`. To start from a clean slate, simply delete that file.

Pressing `SPACE` reveals the romaji for the current kana.

**The romaji used are not the standard ones, but rather the ones I use for normal IME typing. For example I use 'si', 'ci', 'tu' for し、ち、つ, instead of 'shi', 'chi', 'tsu'.**
